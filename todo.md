- Code refactor
    - [ ] Strip out of state -> into game::MCRS??
    - [x] Move out of lib
    - [x] Build a real game loop
- Performance
    - [ ] Instance Culling
        - Now that we can gen new chunks, we can easily have 10k+ instances
        in our render range. That means we need to start being performant
        - Few different spots where we can cull:
            - [x] At a chunk level -> frustum culling
            - At a block (instance) level -> frustum culling, backface culling, occlusion culling
            3. More advanced (GPU-side) culls
        - Can any of this be vectorised??
- Gameplay
    - [ ] Place/break blocks
    - [ ] HUD
    - [ ] Inventory
    - [ ] Player instead of camera
        - [ ] Gravity
        - [ ] Collision detection
